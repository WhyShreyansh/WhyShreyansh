## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Shreyansh Verma**, a **BTech CSE (3rd Year)** student who is deeply passionate about technology and building impactful software solutions.

I believe in **building solutions, not just talking about them**.  
Whenever I face a technical problem and there’s no existing solution that fits, I **design and build one myself**. I love turning ideas into real, working products and continuously improving them through better architecture and execution.

I enjoy building things, experimenting with ideas, and working **end-to-end on products — from design to deployment**.
